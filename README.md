# Retrival-QA
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Question Answering (QA) application that uses OpenAIâ€™s language model in combination with FAISS for fast and accurate document-based search. It allows users to ask questions related to their own data and receive meaningful answers, along with the sources that support those answers.
